Description: An R package that allows for combining tree-boosting with Gaussian process and mixed effects models. It also allows for independently doing tree-boosting as well as inference and prediction for Gaussian process and mixed effects models. See <https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost> for more information on the software and Sigrist (2020) <arXiv:2004.02653> for more information on the methodology.
